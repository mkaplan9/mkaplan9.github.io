<h4>2025-12-21</h4>
<p>I looked into what it would take to start a pottery studio today. The capital investment wouldn't be too bad, so it feels as though labor and rent are the biggest factors affecting feasibility. I wouldn't be aiming for huge profits, but it would be nice not to lose money.</p>
<p>I googled my old studio, 24hr Pottery, and it turns out they're now selling <a href="https://www.24hrpottery.com/">a SaaS product</a> to help owners manage studios with a similar model to theirs. They also have some blog posts with tips on how to start a new studio. Definitely a good place to start if I ever start to get more serious about it.</p>
<p>The things I worry about are</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I have enough pottery experience to do the day-to-day (load kilns, mix glazes, etc.)? No, but could prob easily find a partner</li>
<li>Capital outlay? Probably about $30k. Add an extra $10k for incidentals.
<ul>
<li>Kiln (including installation)       $10k</li>
<li>Ventilation                          $5k</li>
<li>6 wheels                            $10k</li>
<li>Misc prep (tables, shelves, glaze)   $5k</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
</ul>
<p>I think if I had a committed partner with pottery experience I could be convinced to take the leap for sure.</p>
<p>Would I do woodworking instead? Definitely, though the same problems remain, biggest one being that I don't have enough experience to run the day-to-day.</p>

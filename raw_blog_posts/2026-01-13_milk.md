# Warming breastmilk
#### 2026-01-13

Our son eats breastmilk straight from the fridge. At various points I've wondered if he still prefers it at room temperature, but if so the difference is small. But, I started wondering if we should still warm up his breastmilk to get him more calories. He's a _pretty_ good eater, but I always worry that he's getting enough. This week I finally got curious enough to calculate the caloric difference between milk from the fridge (at about 38&deg;F) vs. at room temperature (at about 68&deg;F). Simplifying body temperature as 98&deg;F, we have
- A &Delta;T of 30 vs. 60
- A specific heat of breastmilk of about 0.0166 kcal / 1 oz / degree F
- 1 oz of breastmilk has about 20 kcal of energy
- He eats about 30 oz a day

$$
(\frac{1 kcal}{1 oz * 60 degrees F change} - \frac{0.5 kcal}{1 oz * 30 degrees F change}) * \frac{1 oz breastmilk}{20 kcal} * \frac{30 oz}{1 day}  
= (\frac{1 kcal}{1 oz * 60 degrees F change} - \frac{0.5 kcal}{1 oz * 30 degrees F change})
 * = 0.75 oz/day
$$

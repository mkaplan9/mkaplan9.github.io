# Creating
#### 2025-12-06

Lately I've felt a bit lacking creatively. A combination of not having as much time after Jasper was born, and project spaces feeling out of reach due to distance, price, or class configuration. I've put the climbing gym on pause as well.

I'm still doing a lot of consuming by reading blogs, books, and magazines, and by listening to podcasts, but I want to have some space to create.

My soft goal is to try to create 1 thing each week. This could be a coding project, an app, a drawing, a blog post, etc.

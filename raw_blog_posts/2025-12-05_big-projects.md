# How big things get done
#### 2025-12-25

I'm reading through How Big Things Get Done right now, and thinking about how it applies to starting a business like a pottery studio. Some takeaways so far:
* Look for reference classes. Look at other pottery studios and ask how much were startup costs? How profitable? How much time to start?
* Plan in more detail than you think you have to, particularly with mockups. Planning is cheap, delivery is expensive (this is a lesson in CivClicker too). Where will supplies come from? What will the budget look like for each and every piece, rather than handwaving.
* Start by writing the press release, work backwards for how to get there. What problem are you solving?
* Get experienced people onboard, people who have either run small businesses or run pottery shops or both.

# 24h Hour Pottery
#### 2025-12-21

I looked into what it would take to start a pottery studio today. The capital investment wouldn't be too bad, so it feels as though labor and rent are the biggest factors affecting feasibility. I wouldn't be aiming for huge profits, but it would be nice not to lose money.

I googled my old studio, 24hr Pottery, and it turns out they're now selling [a SaaS product](https://www.24hrpottery.com/) to help owners manage studios with a similar model to theirs. They also have some blog posts with tips on how to start a new studio. Definitely a good place to start if I ever start to get more serious about it.

The things I worry about are
- Do I have enough pottery experience to do the day-to-day (load kilns, mix glazes, etc.)? No, but could prob easily find a partner
- Capital outlay? Probably about $30k. Add an extra $10k for incidentals.
    - Kiln (including installation)       $10k
    - Ventilation                          $5k
    - 6 wheels                            $10k
    - Misc prep (tables, shelves, glaze)   $5k
 - Marketing
 - Accounting

I think if I had a committed partner with pottery experience I could be convinced to take the leap for sure.

Would I do woodworking instead? Definitely, though the same problems remain, biggest one being that I don't have enough experience to run the day-to-day.

# Cheap real estate makes things possible
#### 2025-12-10

Lately third places have been on my mind a lot. The climbing gym, the pottery studio, the tool library -- all of these have served as spaces for projects and casual connections. They're places to go when you can't bear sitting at home alone for the 3rd time in a week, or you want to get the creative juices flowing, or have some casual conversation.

I'd love to open a space like this. A woodshop/pottery studio/coworking space/bar/coffee shop/gym would be so awesome. Buying all that equipment would not be _that_ expensive, and running it via volunteers would make the running costs low too. The barrier is expensive real estate.

Looking at places within a few blocks of where I live, you can't get a space for less than $2000 a month, plus fees (and really the reasonable spaces are more like $4000). It makes it hard to start something.
